# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Weaver GUI Project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please **DO NOT** open a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please report it directly to us via email at [support@weaver.com](mailto:support@weaver.com).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or exploits, if available.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a more detailed response within 5 business days. We will keep you informed of our progress in addressing the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is reported, we will:

1.  Confirm the vulnerability and its impact.
2.  Develop a fix or mitigation strategy.
3.  Release a new version with the fix.
4.  Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (if you agree).

We kindly request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping to keep the Weaver GUI Project secure.
