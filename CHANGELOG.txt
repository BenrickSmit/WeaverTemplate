- Refactored the application's settings to be a centralized 'Settings.h' file. Can now be used to change Vulkan Rendering pipelines too.
- Replaced hardcoded values in 'WeaverInterface.cpp' and 'Canvas.cpp' with configurable constants from 'Settings.h'.
- Introduced new UI, Window, Font, and Rendering namespaces within 'Settings.h' to organize application-wide constants.
- Added customizable colors for minimize, maximize, and close buttons in the UI.
- Update previous minimize, maximize, and close buttons from regular buttons to Menu buttons. This now mimics Visual Studio on Windows.
